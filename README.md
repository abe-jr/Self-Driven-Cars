# Neural networks for Self-Driven Cars

Project where several Neural Networks competes each other to learn to drive on an obstacle track.

# About the Project

The idea is to use an "artificial selection" to evolve the weights of various neural networks, in order to find the best combination and thus obtain the best behavior for cars.

The simulator was built from scratch (without engines) using the **Programming Interface Gaming (PIG)** graphics library, which in turn is based on the traditional **Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL)**.
